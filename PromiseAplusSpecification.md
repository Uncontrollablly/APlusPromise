## Promises/A+

**An open standard for sound, interoperable JavaScript promises—by implementers, for implementers.**

A _promise_ represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which registers callbacks to receive either a promise’s eventual value or the reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.

This specification details the behavior of the `then` method, providing an interoperable base which all Promises/A+ conformant promise implementations can be depended on to provide. As such, the specification should be considered very stable. Although the Promises/A+ organization may occasionally revise this specification with minor backward-compatible changes to address newly-discovered corner cases, we will integrate large or backward-incompatible changes only after careful consideration, discussion, and testing.

Historically, Promises/A+ clarifies the behavioral clauses of the earlier [Promises/A proposal](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises/A), extending it to cover _de facto_ behaviors and omitting parts that are underspecified or problematic.

Finally, the core Promises/A+ specification does not deal with how to create, fulfill, or reject promises, choosing instead to focus on providing an interoperable `then` method. Future work in companion specifications may touch on these subjects.

## 1. Terminology

1.  “promise” is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.
2.  “thenable” is an object or function that defines a `then` method.
3.  “value” is any legal JavaScript value (including `undefined`, a thenable, or a promise).
4.  “exception” is a value that is thrown using the `throw` statement.
5.  “reason” is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1 Promise States

A promise must be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.

- 2.1.1 When pending, a promise:
  - 2.1.1.1 may transition to either the fulfilled or rejected state.
- 2.1.2 When fulfilled, a promise:
  - 2.1.2.1 must not transition to any other state.
  - 2.1.2.2 must have a value, which must not change.
- 2.1.3 When rejected, a promise:
  - 2.1.3.1 must not transition to any other state.
  - 2.1.3.2 must have a reason, which must not change.

Here, “must not change” means immutable identity (i.e. `===`), but does not imply deep immutability.

### 2.2 The `then` Method

A promise must provide a `then` method to access its current or eventual value or reason.

A promise’s `then` method accepts two arguments:

```auto
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)
```

- 2.2.1 Both `onFulfilled` and `onRejected` are optional arguments:
  - 2.2.1.1 If `onFulfilled` is not a function, it must be ignored.
  - 2.2.1.2 If `onRejected` is not a function, it must be ignored.
- 2.2.2 If `onFulfilled` is a function:
  - 2.2.2.1 it must be called after `promise` is fulfilled, with `promise`’s value as its first argument.
  - 2.2.2.2 it must not be called before `promise` is fulfilled.
  - 2.2.2.3 it must not be called more than once.
- 2.2.3 If `onRejected` is a function,
  - 2.2.3.1 it must be called after `promise` is rejected, with `promise`’s reason as its first argument.
  - 2.2.3.2 it must not be called before `promise` is rejected.
  - 2.2.3.3 it must not be called more than once.
- 2.2.4 `onFulfilled` or `onRejected` must not be called until the [execution context](https://es5.github.io/#x10.3) stack contains only platform code. \[[3.1](#notes)\].
- 2.2.5 `onFulfilled` and `onRejected` must be called as functions (i.e. with no `this` value). \[[3.2](#notes)\]
- 2.2.6 `then` may be called multiple times on the same promise.
  - 2.2.6.1 If/when `promise` is fulfilled, all respective `onFulfilled` callbacks must execute in the order of their originating calls to `then`.
  - 2.2.6.2 If/when `promise` is rejected, all respective `onRejected` callbacks must execute in the order of their originating calls to `then`.
- 2.2.7 `then` must return a promise \[[3.3](#notes)\].

  ```auto
   promise2 = promise1.then(onFulfilled, onRejected);
  ```

  - 2.2.7.1 If either `onFulfilled` or `onRejected` returns a value `x`, run the Promise Resolution Procedure `[[Resolve]](promise2, x)`.
  - 2.2.7.2 If either `onFulfilled` or `onRejected` throws an exception `e`, `promise2` must be rejected with `e` as the reason.
  - 2.2.7.3 If `onFulfilled` is not a function and `promise1` is fulfilled, `promise2` must be fulfilled with the same value as `promise1`.
  - 2.2.7.4 If `onRejected` is not a function and `promise1` is rejected, `promise2` must be rejected with the same reason as `promise1`.

### 2.3 The Promise Resolution Procedure

The **promise resolution procedure** is an abstract operation taking as input a promise and a value, which we denote as `[[Resolve]](promise, x)`. If `x` is a thenable, it attempts to make `promise` adopt the state of `x`, under the assumption that `x` behaves at least somewhat like a promise. Otherwise, it fulfills `promise` with the value `x`.

This treatment of thenables allows promise implementations to interoperate, as long as they expose a Promises/A+-compliant `then` method. It also allows Promises/A+ implementations to “assimilate” nonconformant implementations with reasonable `then` methods.

To run `[[Resolve]](promise, x)`, perform the following steps:

- 2.3.1 If `promise` and `x` refer to the same object, reject `promise` with a `TypeError` as the reason.
- 2.3.2 If `x` is a promise, adopt its state \[[3.4](#notes)\]:
  - 2.3.2.1 If `x` is pending, `promise` must remain pending until `x` is fulfilled or rejected.
  - 2.3.2.2 If/when `x` is fulfilled, fulfill `promise` with the same value.
  - 2.3.2.3 If/when `x` is rejected, reject `promise` with the same reason.
- 2.3.3 Otherwise, if `x` is an object or function,
  - 2.3.3.1 Let `then` be `x.then`. \[[3.5](#notes)\]
  - 2.3.3.2 If retrieving the property `x.then` results in a thrown exception `e`, reject `promise` with `e` as the reason.
  - 2.3.3.3 If `then` is a function, call it with `x` as `this`, first argument `resolvePromise`, and second argument `rejectPromise`, where:
    - 2.3.3.3.1 If/when `resolvePromise` is called with a value `y`, run `[[Resolve]](promise, y)`.
    - 2.3.3.3.2 If/when `rejectPromise` is called with a reason `r`, reject `promise` with `r`.
    - 2.3.3.3.3 If both `resolvePromise` and `rejectPromise` are called, or multiple calls to the same argument are made, the first call takes precedence, and any further calls are ignored.
    - 2.3.3.3.4 If calling `then` throws an exception `e`,
      - 2.3.3.3.4.1 If `resolvePromise` or `rejectPromise` have been called, ignore it.
      - 2.3.3.3.4.2 Otherwise, reject `promise` with `e` as the reason.
  - 2.3.3.4 If `then` is not a function, fulfill `promise` with `x`.
- 2.3.4 If `x` is not an object or function, fulfill `promise` with `x`.

If a promise is resolved with a thenable that participates in a circular thenable chain, such that the recursive nature of `[[Resolve]](promise, thenable)` eventually causes `[[Resolve]](promise, thenable)` to be called again, following the above algorithm will lead to infinite recursion. Implementations are encouraged, but not required, to detect such recursion and reject `promise` with an informative `TypeError` as the reason. \[[3.6](#notes)\]

## 4. Notes

1.  Here “platform code” means engine, environment, and promise implementation code. In practice, this requirement ensures that `onFulfilled` and `onRejected` execute asynchronously, after the event loop turn in which `then` is called, and with a fresh stack. This can be implemented with either a “macro-task” mechanism such as [`setTimeout`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#timers) or [`setImmediate`](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/setImmediate/Overview.html#processingmodel), or with a “micro-task” mechanism such as [`MutationObserver`](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-mutationobserver) or [`process.nextTick`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_nexttick_callback). Since the promise implementation is considered platform code, it may itself contain a task-scheduling queue or “trampoline” in which the handlers are called.
2.  That is, in strict mode `this` will be `undefined` inside of them; in sloppy mode, it will be the global object.
3.  Implementations may allow `promise2 === promise1`, provided the implementation meets all requirements. Each implementation should document whether it can produce `promise2 === promise1` and under what conditions.
4.  Generally, it will only be known that `x` is a true promise if it comes from the current implementation. This clause allows the use of implementation-specific means to adopt the state of known-conformant promises.
5.  This procedure of first storing a reference to `x.then`, then testing that reference, and then calling that reference, avoids multiple accesses to the `x.then` property. Such precautions are important for ensuring consistency in the face of an accessor property, whose value could change between retrievals.
6.  Implementations should _not_ set arbitrary limits on the depth of thenable chains, and assume that beyond that arbitrary limit the recursion will be infinite. Only true cycles should lead to a `TypeError`; if an infinite chain of distinct thenables is encountered, recursing forever is the correct behavior.
